# Code Refactor Starter Code
For this weekly challange I first started by analizying the website, trying to find any inconsistencies or errors and right away I noticed the link for "Search Engine Optimization" was not working properly which was the first thing to fix. Secondary, I noticed the head only showed "website" which I switched to "Horiseon". Lastly I changed the color tone for "SEO" in the header to a little bit darker tone, making it a little more noticable to the human eye. 
Then after fixing any errors on the main page I proceded to fix any other minor detail on the index.html,like adding the alt attributes to the images giving them proper messages if unable to load. I then I focused on re-organizing and neatly spacing (using tabs) all the elements to make it more pleasing. 
Lastly I started in the style.css by making comments and re-organizing the structure making it semantic.
